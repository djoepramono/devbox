# Termite

## Ricing

### Main config
config location: `~/.config/termite/config`


### GTK config
Extra cosmetics can be done via gtk located in `~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`. Not that the gtk version might vary.

For example for padding

```
vte-terminal {
  padding:10px;
}
```

## Shortcuts

`ctrl``shift``space` go into vi mode, including search

## Downsides

- It depends on vte-ng and it is very hard to be installed on Ubuntu
- It is not very active anymore
