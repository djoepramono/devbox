# Alacritty

Fast terminal written in Rust and uses GPU to render

Config path `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml` (_may not be available by default_)

### Buffer Search

In the past we need `TMUX` to search the buffer, but nowadays we can use `ctrl+shift+f` and `enter` and `shift+enter` to navigate the results
