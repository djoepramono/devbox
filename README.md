This repository contains necessary stuffs to buid my personal development box.
My current box is Manjaro with zsh. I used to run Ubuntu, and thus the scripts in this repo might be geared towards Manjaro / Ubuntu.

This repository contains but not limited to
- ricing dotfiles
- editor setups
- custom scripts

There are READMEs in almost every folder. You can refer to it for more information.
