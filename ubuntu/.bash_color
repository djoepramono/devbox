# Hint
# color scheme starts with \e[ or \033[ 
# color scheme is ; delimited and it's in this format background;font-decoration;text-color. If you want default just put nothing
# color scheme ends with m
# to reset a color scheme you can put nothing between \033[ and m
# to reset_color or any color scheme that has length 0, you need to enclose everything with [ and ] 
#   otherwise bash sometimes cannot get the length of the prompt right and 
#   as a result pressing up arrow to brose the history might leak previous command
# remember you need to escape \ and the enclosing []
